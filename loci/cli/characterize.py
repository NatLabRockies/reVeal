    """
    Characterize a vector grid based on specified raster and vector datasets.
    Outputs a new GeoPackage containing the input grid with added attributes for the
    user-specified characterizations.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data_dir : str
        Path to parent directory containing all geospatial raster and vector datasets
        to be used for grid characterization.
    grid : str
        Path to gridded vector dataset for which characterization will be performed.
        Must be an existing vector polygon dataset in a format that can be opened by
        pyogrio. Does not strictly need to be a grid, but some functionality may
        not work if it is not.
    characterizations: dict
        Characterizations to be performed. Must be a dictionary keyed by the name of
        the output attribute for each characterization. Each value must be another
        dictionary with the following keys:
            - "dset": String indicating relative path within data_dir to dataset to be
                characterized.
            - "method": String indicating characterization method to be performed.
            - "attribute": Attribute to summarize. Only required for certain methods.
                Default is None/null.
            - "apply_exclusions": Boolean indicating whether exclusions should be
                applied before characterization. Optional, default is False.
            - "neighbor_order": Integer indicating the order of neighbors to include
                in the characterization of each grid cell. For example,
                neighbor_order=1 would result in included first-order queen's case
                neighbors. Optional, default is 0 which does not include neighbors.
            - "buffer_distance": Float indicating buffer distance to apply in the
                characterization of each grid cell. Units are based on the CRS of the
                input grid dataset. For instance, a value of 500 in CRS EPGS:5070
                would apply a buffer of 500m to each grid cell before characterization.
                Optional, default is 0 which does not apply a buffer.
    expressions: dict
        Additional expressions to be calculated. Must be a dictionary keyes by the name
        of the output attribute for each expression. Each value must be a string
        indicating the expression to be calculated. Expression strings can reference
        one or more attributes/keys referenced in the characterizations dictionary.
    max_workers : [int, NoneType], optional
        Maximum number of workers to use for multiprocessing, by default None, which
        uses all available CPUs.
    _local : bool
        Flag indicating whether the code is being run locally or via HPC job
        submissions. NOTE: This is not a user provided parameter - it is determined
        dynamically by based on whether config["execution_control"]["option"] == "local"
        (defaults to True if not specified).
